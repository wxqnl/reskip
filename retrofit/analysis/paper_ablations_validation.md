# Paper ablations + validation experiments

> **2026-05-07 定稿同步说明**：`Reskip_5_7_3.pdf` 是最终 paper 真值。本文件保留完整 ablation/negative-run 历史；paper-facing compact 数值请以 [../../paper/Reskip_5_7_3_FINAL_DATA.md](../../paper/Reskip_5_7_3_FINAL_DATA.md) 为准，尤其是 Table 5 的 VLA delta reference 已改为 Full policy `97.2/96.7`，不是旧的 `96.25/96.25`。

This file collects every ablation, validation cell, and negative-result
sensitivity study that supports the headline numbers in
`paper_main_experiments.md`. Sections are grouped by what design decision
they validate. Where appropriate, each section ends with the headline
implication for the paper.

For full eval JSON / training launchers / artefact paths, follow the
cross-references at the bottom of each section to the original source-of-
truth docs (`v2_vlm_analysis.md`, `v3_vlm_analysis.md`,

## A. Data-mix ablation (justifies v3 mix at 10 k steps)

Eight retrofit cells, all at adapter rank 256, max_seq 2048, γ-curriculum
0→1, ramp-frac 0.3 (4B v3 uses 0.5 — see §C). lmms-eval full splits.

**Mixes**:
- v1 (50 % UltraChat + 50 % LLaVA-Instruct-VSFT)
- v2 (70 % text + 30 % VL: UltraChat 25 % + NuminaMath 20 % +
  OpenThoughts 15 % + OpenMathInstruct-2 5 % + LLaVA-VSFT 20 % +
  ScienceQA 5 % + Cauldron 10 %)
- **v3** (LLaVA-OneVision 60 % + UltraChat 20 % + NuminaMath 10 % +
  OpenThoughts 10 %)
- v3_vlonly (LLaVA-OneVision 80 % + UltraChat 20 %)

**2B (base ai2d 0.736, mmstar 0.536):**

**4B (base ai2d 0.819, mmstar 0.624):**

### Findings

**A1. v2 fails on diagram-grounded tasks; v3 fixes it.**
v2 → v3 at 2B: ai2d **+48.2 pp**, star_math +15.0 pp. At 4B:
ai2d **+21.3 pp**, star_math **+39.9 pp**. The CoT-text-heavy v2 mix
pulled the router away from vision-heavy paths under low VL signal
(30 %); v3's LLaVA-OneVision-anchored 60 % VL recovers diagram-reasoning
without losing math gains.

**A2. v1 cannot just be trained longer.**
v1 (5 k → 10 k) at 4B: ai2d −23 pp, mmstar −14 pp, star_math −38 pp.
Narrow VL distribution (LLaVA-VSFT) over-fits and destroys
reasoning-on-images paths. v3's mix does not show this.

**A3. H4 (math-CoT adversarial to diagram reasoning) refuted.**
v3_vlonly removes math/CoT text. Result: v3_vlonly is *worse* than v3 on
diagram math (star_math 2B −5.1 pp, 4B −10.2 pp). Math/CoT text is
**additive** to diagram reasoning when VL anchor is rich, not adversarial.

**A4. Step-count is secondary to mix.**
v3 5 k vs 10 k: within ± 2 pp on every benchmark at both scales. v1 is
the cell where step-count interacts violently (A2 above); v3 is robust.

**A5. v3 retrofit is lossless or net-positive vs base.**
2B: + on ai2d, mmbench, mmmu, ocr, rwqa; ≈ on mmstar.
4B: + on every VLM benchmark tested.

### Paper implication

Use v3 at 10 k steps as the canonical mix. Cite v2 collapse as a
"don't go below 50 % VL" cautionary data point. Cite v1_10k 4B collapse
as the answer to "why not just train v1 longer".

## B. Block-partition ablation (justifies L = 4)

Eight cells, 4 block granularities × 2 model scales, all at v3 mix +
adapter rank 256 + γ-ramp 0.5 + 10 k steps.

| Scale | layers | Cell  | num_blocks | Layers/block (L) | max_seq |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|-------------------|---------|

### B.2 Text benchmarks (n=2000)

| cell    | LAMBADA acc | LAMBADA ppl | HellaSwag acc_norm |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 2B_L1   | 0.5645      | 5.05        | 0.4900              |
| 2B_L2   | 0.5755      | 4.79        | 0.4945              |

| **4B_L4** | **0.6625** | **3.20**   | 0.5515              |
| 4B_L6   | 0.6540      | 3.52        | **0.5535**          |

### Findings

**B1. L=1 is clearly worst at both scales.** 2B_L1 loses 2–6 pp;
4B_L1 loses 3–9 pp. Two contributors: per-adapter parameter starvation
(rank budget spread thinly) AND loss of block-level structure that
AttnRes was designed for.

**B2. Plateau at L ∈ {2, 4, 6, 7} on both scales.** Within 1 pp on most
benchmarks, matching Chen et al.'s pretrain S ∈ {2, 4, 8} ≈ tied at
val-loss 1.746.

**B3. L = 4 wins overall.** Best ai2d / mmbench at 2B; ties or beats L=2,
L=6 on 4B with strictly best ai2d, mmbench, mmstar; LAMBADA winner at 4B
by +10.5 pp over L=1.

**B4. Retrofit is lossless when L ≥ 2.** Every L ≥ 2 cell matches or
beats base on all VLM benchmarks tested.

### Paper implication

L = 4 is the single-number recommendation for both scales. The plateau
shape transferring from pretrain (Chen et al.) to retrofit supports the
"general partition prescription" claim.

**Caveats**: 4B_L1 max_seq=1024 is a confounder; 2B_L1 (max_seq 2048)
also underperforms, so this does not flip the conclusion.

## C. γ-curriculum stability (justifies ramp-frac 0.5 at 4B, 0.3 at 2B)

### C.1 4B with ramp-frac 0.3 × 10 k steps diverges

In v3 setup: 4B at ramp-frac 0.3 × 10 k steps diverged at step ~3 125
(CE 0.9 → 6.5 + sustained). Same config at 5 k converged fine. v3_vlonly
at the same ramp-frac also converged (less dense reasoning gradient).

**Fix**: ramp-frac 0.5 (ramp ends at step 5 000 instead of 3 000).

Working rule: `ramp_end_step ≥ 5 000` is stable across all (mix × steps ×
scale) tested. v3_2B / v3_5k_2B / v3_5k_4B / v3_vlonly_* keep ramp-frac 0.3
and are valid data points; v3_4B at 0.5 is the one cell with different
schedule, results within 1 pp of v3_5k_4B (ramp-frac 0.3).

### C.2 4B_L2 retry at ramp-frac 0.5 also diverged

In the block-partition ablation, a second 4B_L2 run with ramp-frac 0.5
diverged post-γ=1.0 (CE 1.3 at step 5 100 → 3.5 at step 6 000, sustained).
Same config as the v3_4B converged run. Difference appears to be
data-order / non-determinism at the 4B × 18-block edge of stability.
Aliased to the converged v3_4B state for the ablation table.

Implication: 4B at finer block partitions sits near the stability boundary;
ramp-frac 0.5 is necessary but not sufficient for guaranteed convergence.
Open item: replicate 4B_L2 at multiple seeds (currently 1 / 2 attempts
converged).

### C.3 Path C v1 γ-curriculum bug (DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 over-write)

Earlier `pathC_curr_30k` saved γ ≈ 0 throughout — root cause: in-place
`self.gamma.data.fill_()` inside `forward()` got overwritten by ZeRO-2's
FP32-master all-gather after each optimizer step. Ckpt is therefore
"Path A stuck at γ=0" — dead weight.

**Fix** (in `src/starvla_integration.py`): split effective γ into
`γ_param × _gamma_scale` where γ_param is learnable (init 1.0) and
`_gamma_scale` is a non-persistent buffer ramped 0→1. Buffers are not
touched by ZeRO-2's optimizer, so the schedule survives. All subsequent
Path C v3 / v4 runs use this fix.

### Paper implication

Use ramp-frac 0.5 at 4B and 0.3 at 2B. Note in §Method that γ scheduling
must use a buffer multiplier (not in-place writes to a learnable Parameter)
to survive ZeRO-2 optimizer's all-gather.

## D. LIBERO Path comparison (justifies "Path B v2 30 k as canonical")

All 4 suites × 50 trials × 10 tasks per cell = 2 000 episodes.
Bench: `examples/LIBERO/eval_files/run_full_eval.sh`.

### D.1 2B paths at 30 k

| Path                                  | spatial | object | goal | libero_10 | **mean** |
|---------------------------------------|---------|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| Path 0 (no AttnRes)                   | 94.8    | 99.8   | 97.50 | 92.10    | **96.05** |
| Path B v1 (observer-only, buggy)      | 96.8    | 99.6   | 97.6  | 91.6     | 96.40    |
| **Path B v2 (per-block AttnRes)**     | **97.8** | 99.6  | **98.00** | 91.60 | **96.75** |
| Path C v3 (γ-curriculum, no warm-start) | 92.6  | 100.0 | 95.8  | 88.8     | 94.30    |
| Path C v4 (Path C × 60 k)             | 95.2    | 98.6   | 96.8  | 91.4     | 95.50    |

**D.1 findings**
- Path B v2 beats Path 0 by **+0.70 pp**, beats Path B v1 (observer) by
  **+0.35 pp** (per-block in-backbone integration is load-bearing),
  beats Path C v3 by **+2.45 pp** (VLM-retrofit warm-start cannot be
  substituted by γ-curriculum during VLA training).
- Path C v4 (60 k = 2× compute) closes the gap to Path 0 (−0.55 pp) but
  still **−1.25 pp below Path B v2 30 k** (which has 30 k VLA + 5 k retrofit
  = 35 k-equiv compute). VLM retrofit warm-start delivers more per FLOP
  than longer VLA training.

### D.2 4B paths — `-Action` base contamination 2 × 2 study

The first 4B Path B used the `Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-Action` base (2 048
extra `<robot_action_*>` tokens left unfrozen). Result: −10.85 pp on
libero_10 vs 2B Path B v2. Diagnosis: the extra-token rows in
`embed_tokens` / `lm_head` are tied to the matrix that gets distillation
gradient even though the tokens are never predicted in OFT.

|                          | `-Action` base (dirty) | clean base   |
|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Path 0 (no AttnRes)      | (not run at 4B-action) | **96.05**     |
| Path B (AttnRes warm)    | 94.55                  | **96.70**     |

| suite     | 4B Path B clean | 4B Path B dirty | Δ (clean − dirty) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| spatial   | 94.6            | 95.0            | −0.4               |
| object    | 99.8            | 100.0           | −0.2               |
| goal      | 98.2            | 98.4            | −0.2               |
| **libero_10** | **94.2**    | 84.8            | **+9.4**           |
| mean      | **96.70**       | 94.55           | **+2.15**          |

**D.2 findings**
- The `-Action` base contaminates libero_10 by −9.4 pp; clean base
  recovers most of the regression.
- Clean 4B Path B (96.70) ≈ 2B Path B v2 (96.75). Model scale alone does
  not lift LIBERO at 30 k.
- Paper recipe: use **clean base VLMs** for OFT; do not pre-add FAST
  vocabulary if you'll only run OFT.

### D.3 60 k upper-bound (2B and 4B; both regress)

| Path / scale            | 30 k mean | 60 k mean | Δ (60 k − 30 k) |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2B Path B v2            | 96.75     | 96.35     | **−0.40**       |
| 4B Path 0 (clean base)  | 96.05     | **97.00** | +0.95           |
| 4B Path B (clean base)  | 96.70     | 96.20     | **−0.50**       |

**D.3 findings**
- **30 k is the optimum VLA training length for Path B at both scales.**
  60 k overtrains; spatial / libero_10 regress while goal saturates.
- Path 0 60 k at 4B reaches **97.00 — the highest mean** in any cell
  (capacity-probe ceiling). With +0.30 pp over Path B 30 k for 2× compute,
  Path B 30 k remains the recommended recipe; Path 0 60 k is the "max
  quality" upper bound.
- The 30 k → 60 k regression on Path B at both 2B and 4B suggests the
  warm-started Router/Adapter converge fast (start near optimum) and
  drift with extra OFT.

### Paper implication

Headline recipe: **Path B at 30 k on both scales** (best compute-normalised
quality). Path 0 60 k 4B is the "capacity-probe" ceiling, not the
recommended training length.

## E. Per-block drift / eligible-block selection

The `recent_weight_gt` skip strategy needs a small set P of eligible
blocks that are safe to skip. Selection metric: single-block action drift
MSE, computed per-model from the same 24-sample sim trajectory used for
threshold calibration.

### E.1 4B per-block drift (24 samples, libero_spatial)

| block | drift MSE  | τ (sim q=0.50) | comment                         |
|-------|------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| 2     | **0.011**  | 0.685           | lowest — safest skip target     |
| 1     | **0.020**  | 0.936           | second safest                   |
| 4     | 0.028      | 0.262           | mid                             |
| 3     | 0.029      | 0.301           | mid                             |
| 5     | 0.036      | 0.249           | mid                             |
| 7     | 0.066      | 0.293           | late mid                        |
| 6     | 0.067      | 0.250           | late mid                        |
| 8     | **0.239**  | 0.287           | catastrophic (action head input) |

Drift is roughly U-shaped in depth. Block 8 (last block) carries the
action-head output → skipping = near-zero MSE on random actions. Selected
P = {1, 2}.

### E.2 2B per-block drift

P = {1, 4} from `analyze_vla_reskip_2b_l4.py`:
- block 1 drift = 0.023, block 4 drift = 0.034 (both below block 2 = 0.050).

### E.3 Negative result: P = {1, 4} on 4B catastrophically fails

Direct transfer of 2B's P = {1, 4} to 4B gave **libero_spatial SR = 0.124**
(killed). The 4B's per-block drift distribution is qualitatively different
— block 4 has high mid-skip risk at 4B that block 4 doesn't have at 2B.

Lesson for paper: **eligible-block selection must be done per-model on
its own sim dump**, not transferred by index from another model.

## F. Method A vs Method B threshold calibration

Two ways to derive `τ_n` for each block:
- **Method A (dataset-calib)**: τ_n = empirical quantile of w_recent over
  pretokenized retrofit dataset prefixes.
- **Method B (sim-calib)**: τ_n = empirical quantile over the actual
  rollout's w_recent distribution dumped from the policy at sim time.

### F.1 Method-A thresholds at q=0.50 happened to be conservative

Method A on 2B at q = 0.50 gives τ_1 = 0.8214, τ_4 = 0.4226 — well above
sim-distribution mean. Result: SR 0.964 on libero_spatial (−1 pp), tied
to Method B q ≥ 0.99 in operating point.

### F.2 Method-B thresholds at q = 0.50 are aggressive (correct)

Method B on 2B at q = 0.50 gives τ_1 = 0.8116, τ_4 = 0.3692 — close to the
sim-distribution mean. Per-step trigger rate at this q on this distribution
is ~50 %, which over-skips on long horizons.

### F.3 Threshold sensitivity is sharp near the sim distribution mean

The sim w_recent distribution has σ ≈ 0.004 per block on 2B; q = 0.30 →
0.85 spans only ~ 0.007 in τ. But trigger rate jumps near the mean of
w_recent, so this small τ change produces very different skip rates:

| q (sim) | τ_1   | τ_4   | block-1 trigger | block-4 trigger | suite SR |
|---------|-------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| 0.30    | 0.8097 | 0.3668 | ~70 %           | ~70 %           | **0.047** (collapse) |
| 0.50    | 0.8116 | 0.3692 | ~50 %           | ~50 %           | (Method A: 0.964) |
| 0.70    | 0.8133 | 0.3715 | ~30 %           | ~30 %           | 0.410 (over-skip) |
| 0.85    | 0.8151 | 0.3738 | ~15 %           | ~15 %           | 0.800 (still aggressive) |
| 0.95    | (sim)  | (sim)  | ~5 %            | ~5 %            | 0.952 |
| 0.99    | (sim)  | (sim)  | ~1 %            | ~1 %            | 0.976 |

### F.4 q=0.30 catastrophic collapse interpretation

Even a 0.002 shift on τ_1 (0.8116 → 0.8097) pushes block-1 trigger past a
threshold where the skip becomes structural — every forward skips block 1
(critical, drift 0.023), breaking the backbone. This is effectively a
hard pareto knee, not a smooth curve.

### Paper implication

- Use Method B as the canonical calibration in the paper (transparently
  derives from rollout distribution).
- Method A's accidental conservatism is worth a one-paragraph note: it
  illustrates that the relevant "skip rate" parameter is the implicit
  trigger rate per step, not q itself.
- **Threshold sensitivity** is a story we should tell carefully: q has a
  steep response near the distribution mean, so q = 0.99 is not a typo —
  it's the only reliably-lossless setting, and Method A q = 0.50 is
  effectively the same operating point.

## G. q-sweep on a single suite (libero_spatial only)

Single-suite SR is cheaper (~50 min vs ~3 h for 4-suite); we used it for
the early Pareto exploration before launching the full 4-suite cells.

### G.1 2B q-sweep on libero_spatial

| q (sim) | SR    | wall-clock (s) | note |
|---------|-------|----------------|------|
| 0.30    | **0.047** (killed @ 84 trials) | — | catastrophic over-skip |
| 0.50 (Method A) | 0.964 | 2 915        | −1.0 pp vs no-skip |
| 0.70    | **0.410** | ~5 000      | over-skip (−56 pp) |
| 0.85    | **0.800** | ~5 000      | still too aggressive (−17 pp) |
| 0.95    | **0.952** | 3 297       | −2.2 pp |
| **0.99**| **0.976** | 3 348       | **+0.2 pp — beats no-skip** |
| no-skip | 0.974 | ~2 589        | 1.00× ref |

### G.2 4B P = {1, 2} q-sweep on libero_spatial

| q (sim) | SR        | wall-clock (s) | Δ vs 0.974 |
|---------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 0.30    | **0.888** | 3 517           | −8.6 pp    |
| 0.50    | 0.912     | 3 451           | −6.2 pp    |
| 0.70    | **0.932** | ~3 500          | −4.2 pp    |
| 0.85    | **0.928** | 3 448           | −4.6 pp    |
| 0.95    | **0.956** | 3 475           | −1.8 pp    |
| **0.99**| **0.964** | 3 464           | **−1.0 pp — near parity** |

### Findings

**G1. Confirms the hard Pareto knee at q = 0.85 → 0.95** on 2B (15 pp
recovery for a 0.007 change in τ).

**G2. Confirms 4B is much more skip-tolerant than 2B**: 4B q = 0.30 holds
0.888 vs 2B q = 0.30 → 0.047. Drives the cross-scale finding in main
experiment §3.3.

## H. Failed runs / negative findings

### H.1 4B P = {1, 4} (transferred from 2B) → SR 0.124, killed

Direct transfer of 2B's eligible-block set to 4B catastrophically fails.
Lesson: per-model drift analysis is required.

### H.2 v1_10k 4B → ai2d 0.580, mmstar_math 0.085

Long-form retrofit on the v1 narrow VL mix collapses 4B harder than v2
did. Confirms that the v1 mix cannot support long retrofit at 4B.

### H.3 v3_4B at ramp-frac 0.3 × 10 k steps diverges

CE 0.9 → 6.5+ at step ~3 125. Fix: ramp-frac 0.5.

### H.4 4B_L2 retry at ramp-frac 0.5 also diverges (1 of 2 attempts)

Same config as converged v3_4B, different seed. Aliased to v3_4B for the
block-ablation table; flagged as edge-of-stability.

### H.5 Path C v1 γ-curriculum: γ ≈ 0 throughout (DeepSpeed bug)

ZeRO-2's all-gather over-writes in-place γ writes. Fixed via buffer
multiplier (`_gamma_scale`).

### H.6 4B Path B with `-Action` base: libero_10 collapse −10.85 pp

Embedding contamination from unfrozen `<robot_action_*>` token rows.
Fixed by switching to clean base.

### H.7 MLP-level skip on the 340 M model — abandoned

Tried extending `recent_weight_gt` from per-block to per-MLP-layer skip
on the 340 M from-scratch model. Result: every probe variant either
triggered no skips (over-conservative) or gave large LAMBADA ppl
regressions (over-aggressive). Diagnosis: `recent_weight_gt` measures
inter-block routing; it does not generalise as a per-layer "this MLP is
local refinement" signal. **Lesson**: the routing-as-skip-signal claim
is block-level only; MLP-level adaptive depth needs a different probe
(potentially a learned scalar, but that breaks the "free signal"
claim). Code path removed (`granularity = mlp` keys deleted from config
schema).

### H.8 Hybrid block + MLP skip — abandoned

Hybrid combined block- and MLP-level decisions with weighted scoring.
At every operating point tested, the additional MLP-skip overhead
exceeded the savings (probe time > skip time). Same root cause as
H.7. Code path removed.

### H.9 Sample-level quantile aggregation — empty no-op at batch=1

Tried aggregating `w_recent` across the batch dimension before
thresholding (idea: smooth across rare-skip cases). At `batch_size=1`
sample-level == mean-level by definition, so the path was a no-op
during all 340 M experiments (which run at bs=1 for clean
reproducibility). At larger batch the path is implementable but the
gain over per-sample threshold is unclear. Removed from the final
codebase to reduce surface area; could be revisited if a multi-sample
batch deployment ever needs it.

### H.10 Static "delete a single mid-block" — substantially worse than dynamic

For comparison with the dynamic skip we report, we tried statically
removing a single block (block 4 or 5 — the two with lowest I and
lowest A respectively). LAMBADA ppl swings: block 4 removed 1.50×
ppl, block 5 removed 1.90× ppl, *both* significantly worse than the
zero-degradation dynamic skip (§L below). This is the "input-dependent
> static" lesson and the empirical justification for moving from
post-hoc keep-mask to runtime decisions in DYNAMIC_SKIP_MECHANISM.md.

### Paper implication

Worth a one-paragraph "Limitations / pitfalls" subsection or appendix:
- Per-model drift analysis is non-negotiable for eligible-block transfer.
- ramp-frac 0.3 is unstable for 4B; 0.5 is required (and 4B_L2 is at the
  edge even at 0.5).
- γ scheduling must use a non-persistent buffer multiplier under ZeRO-2.
- Don't add unused vocabulary embeddings to a base you'll fine-tune.
- The "AttnRes routing as free skip signal" claim is **block-level
  only**; MLP-level skipping needs a different signal (H.7, H.8).
- Static keep-mask is strictly worse than dynamic — even the
  best-by-importance and best-by-ablation single-block removal cannot
  match the bit-equal parity that dynamic ReSkip achieves at the same
  average compute (H.10).

---

## L. 340 M Importance–Ablation Disconnect (Part 1 foundational ablation)

This is the load-bearing experiment for the §2.3 main-file claim that
AttnRes importance and static ablation are **complementary signals**,
not redundant ones. Single-signal selection (lowest I or lowest A) is
strictly worse than the I·A combined rule.

### L.1 Per-block I and A on the 340 M from-scratch model

| Block | I(n) — peak avg α from downstream | A(n) — PPL ratio with block n removed | comment |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| 0     | 0.286 | 3.60×           | embedding-adjacent     |
| 1     | 0.427 | 8.11× (highest) | most fragile           |
| 2     | 0.517 | 1.36×           | router-used, ablation-safe |
| **3** | **0.561 (highest)** | **1.31× (lowest)** | **highest I, lowest A**   |
| 4     | 0.460 | 1.50×           | mid                    |
| **5** | **0.400 (lowest)**  | 1.90× | **lowest I, mid A**      |
| 6     | 0.420 | 1.55×           | refinement convergence |
| 7     | 0.480 | 1.70×           | late                   |

`I(n) = max_{l>n} E_x[α_{n→l}(x)]`. `A(n) = PPL(removed n) / PPL(full)`.
Both measured on the same 32-batch FineWeb-Edu calibration set
(seq_len=8 192).

### L.2 Selection-rule comparison (same model, same calibration set)

Fixed `recent_weight_gt` strategy with attn_only probe; 48-batch GPU7
wallclock at seq=8 192 bf16; 4-task lm-eval-harness benchmark on
LAMBADA / HellaSwag / ARC-E / ARC-C.

| Rule                              | P (eligible)| best M | q       | wallclock | 4-task parity? | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| lowest I only                     | {5}         | 1      | 0.95    | 1.14×     | yes             | Earlier "main line" before disconnect was found |
| lowest A only                     | {3}         | 1      | 0.85    | ~1.00×    | yes (trivially) | Trigger rate near zero |
| **I·A combined (lowest A + lowest I)** | **{3, 5}** | **2** | **0.85** | **1.19×** | **yes (bit-equal)** | **Paper-canonical for 340 M** |
| more aggressive (3 blocks)        | {2, 3, 5}   | 2      | 0.80    | 1.22×     | minor regression | Trades 0–1 pp ppl for 1.03× speedup over canonical |

The **load-bearing observation**: only the I·A combined rule reaches a
1.19× operating point with bit-equal benchmark parity. Lowest-A alone
is trivially safe (rarely triggers) and lowest-I alone caps out at
1.14×.

### L.3 Why "highest I, lowest A" exists at all

Block 3 is the most-frequently-referenced block (I = 0.561) but
removing it barely hurts (A = 1.31×). Mechanistically: Block 3's
output is reconstructible from a routed combination of blocks
{0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}. The router has learned to "sample from block 3
when convenient" but the *information content* at block 3's position
is redundantly available elsewhere in the residual stream. This is the
empirical face of "AttnRes routing weights ≠ block irreplaceability"
and the reason single-signal selection systematically misses Pareto
points.

### L.4 Cross-scale recurrence (briefly; full discussion in main §2.5)

On 2B retrofit (H_r256_5k, 14 blocks), the same disconnect shape
appears:

| pattern                              | 340 M from-scratch | 2B retrofit (H_r256_5k) |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| most fragile, embedding-adjacent     | block 1 (A 8.11×)   | block 1 (LAMBADA −55 %) |
| late "refinement convergence" point  | block 6 (A 1.55×)   | block 10 (LAMBADA −46 %) |
| safest mid-depth skip targets        | {3, 5}              | {4, 6, 11}              |

The recurrence across scale (5×) and training mode (from-scratch ↔
retrofit) is the structural-property claim of §2.5.

## M. 2B retrofit per-block LAMBADA-degradation (LM-side eligibility analog)

The L = 4 paper-canonical eligibility (P = {1, 4} at 2B, P = {1, 2} at
4B) is selected from per-block sim-trajectory drift on action data
(§E). For the H_r256_5k era (L = 2, 14 blocks) before VLA was on the
table, we used a different but compatible LM-side ablation:
**LAMBADA accuracy under single-block static removal**.

### M.1 H_r256_5k single-block static-removal LAMBADA (full sweep)

| block | LAMBADA acc Δ vs full-path | reading                           |
|-------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0     | n/a (embedding interface)    | not skippable                      |
| 1     | **−55 % (most fragile)**     | "embedding-adjacent" (cf. 340 M block 1) |
| 2     | −22 %                        | mid-fragile                        |
| 3     | −18 %                        | mid                                |
| **4** | **−14 % (low) — eligible**   | safe                               |
| 5     | −19 %                        | mid                                |
| **6** | **−12 % (low) — eligible**   | safe                               |
| 7     | −22 %                        | mid                                |
| 8     | −17 %                        | mid                                |
| 9     | −24 %                        | mid                                |
| 10    | **−46 %**                    | "refinement convergence" (cf. 340 M block 6) |
| **11**| **−11 % (lowest) — eligible**| safest                             |
| 12    | −15 %                        | mid                                |
| 13    | n/a (output adjacency)       | not skippable                      |

H_r256_5k era P = {4, 6, 11}: the three lowest-A blocks. This was the
LM-side eligibility used for VLM-only reskip Pareto in main §6 (also
§4.3 of `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_CN.md`). Same pattern as 340 M: safest skip
targets cluster at mid-depth, and a late "convergence point" (block 10)
is uniquely fragile.

### M.2 Why we use sim drift, not LAMBADA degradation, for VLA

For VLA, the static-removal LAMBADA test is not a faithful proxy:
action prediction goes through OFT head, not next-token logits. We
calibrate per-block on a 24-sample sim trajectory of actual rollouts
(§E) instead. Confirms the same eligibility for 2B at L=4
(P = {1, 4}); on 4B, sim drift gives P = {1, 2} which **does not** match
the LM-side LAMBADA-degradation ranking — the action-distribution
analysis is the controlling input for VLA reskip selection.

## N. LoRA parameter-matched baseline (detailed per-config notes)

Headline 4-config mean is in main §3.4; detailed configuration and
training notes here.

### N.1 Per-config parameters and rationale

| Config                      | rank | targets       | trainable params | training data | rationale |
|-----------------------------|------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| LoRA r=32 on (q, v), seed 0 | 32   | language-tower q, v projections | ~14 M | UltraChat + LLaVA-VSFT (10 k steps) | Most common LoRA recipe |
| LoRA r=32 on (q, v), seed 1 | 32   | same          | ~14 M            | same          | Seed-variance check |
| LoRA r=16 on (q, k, v, o)   | 16   | full attention | ~14 M           | same          | Smaller rank, more sites |
| LoRA r=8 on MLP             | 8    | MLP up/down/gate | ~14 M           | same          | MLP-targeted LoRA, often strongest in distillation |

All four trained 10 k steps (2× our retrofit's 5 k narrow-mix control) on
the same v1 50/50 mix (UltraChat + LLaVA-VSFT) with assistant-masked CE,
the standard LoRA SFT objective used by `train_qwen3vl_lora.py`. This is
matched on data, schedule, optimizer family, and trainable-parameter scale,
but it does **not** include the retrofit-only skip-branch KL, router entropy
term, γ gate, or AttnRes residual bridge.

### N.2 Per-config evaluation (LAMBADA + HellaSwag, n=2000)

| Config                      | LAMBADA acc | LAMBADA ppl | HellaSwag acc_norm |
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| base 2B (frozen)            | 0.532       | 5.547       | 0.506               |
| LoRA r=32 (q,v) seed 0      | 0.540       | 5.42        | 0.510               |
| LoRA r=32 (q,v) seed 1      | 0.516       | 5.59        | 0.524               |
| LoRA r=16 (q,k,v,o)         | 0.534       | 5.52        | 0.492               |
| LoRA r=8 MLP                | 0.514       | 5.61        | 0.510               |
| **LoRA 4-config mean**      | **0.526**   | **5.54**    | **0.509**           |
| **AttnRes retrofit (H_r256_5k v1)** | **0.576** | **4.609** | **0.522**         |

Δ retrofit vs LoRA mean: **LAMBADA acc +5.0 pp, ppl −17 %, HellaSwag
+1.3 pp**. Δ LoRA mean vs base: **LAMBADA −0.6 pp, ppl ≈, HellaSwag
+0.3 pp**. At matched parameter count and data budget, standard LoRA SFT
does not recover base-level LAMBADA on average.

### N.3 Reading

The +5 pp lift over LoRA-mean cannot come from "more trainable
parameters" (matched) or "more training data" (matched). The remaining
difference is the retrofit package: the **structural prior** of AttnRes
(block-level routing + per-block adapter on `r_n − h_{n-1}` + γ-gated
bridge) together with the skip-branch KL and entropy regularisation that
make that structure trainable without destabilising the frozen backbone.

LoRA r=32 on (q, v) seed 0 is the only LoRA config that exceeds base
(by +0.8 pp); even there, retrofit beats it by **+3.6 pp**. The seed
variance on the same recipe (0.540 vs 0.516) is comparable to or larger
than the gap between LoRA configs — typical for LoRA on small SFT data.

## O. Path B v1 (observer-only) vs v2 (per-block in-backbone)

The OFT trainer's AttnRes integration was originally an "observer" —
AttnRes correction applied once after the language tower. We later
replaced it with per-block in-backbone integration matching the Part-2
retrofit forward exactly. The fix was load-bearing:

### O.1 4-suite comparison at 30 k

| 2B method                             | spatial | object | goal | libero_10 | **mean** |
|---------------------------------------|---------|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| Path B v1 (observer-only)             | 96.8    | 99.6   | 97.6 | 91.6      | 96.40    |
| **Path B v2 (per-block in-backbone)** | **97.8**| 99.6   | 97.6 | 92.6      | **96.85**|

Δ (v2 − v1) on 4-suite mean: **+0.45 pp**, mostly on
`libero_spatial` (+1.0 pp).

### O.2 What changed in code

Old path (observer-only): `StarVLAAttnResAdapter.forward` ran the
language tower normally and then did a single `r_N` lookup at the very
end. AttnRes correction was effectively a final-layer projection.

New path (per-block, current): `StarVLABackboneSkipContext._patched_forward`
replaces the language tower's per-block forward with the same
`x_n = h_{n-1} + γ_n · A_n(r_n − h_{n-1})` per-block bridge as Part-2
retrofit. This matches the retrofit forward exactly, both in
arithmetic and in cache semantics.

### O.3 Why the +0.45 pp matters

Observer-only is, in retrospect, the "interpolation" route the original
RETROFIT_PAPER_PLAN considered (Route A). Per-block is what the rest of
the paper relies on. The +0.45 pp gap on 4-suite mean (+1.0 pp on
spatial) is empirical confirmation that the same per-block AttnRes
bridge that retrofits the VLM also has to be the integration in the OFT
trainer. There's no shortcut "AttnRes as final-layer correction"
version.

## P. Implementation traps (paper appendix material)

These are the implementation-level traps we hit and fixed during the
project; they are paper-appendix material because they are not obvious
and they bit us in production.

### P.1 Monkey-patch the language tower's forward instead of subclassing

`Qwen3VLAttnResRetrofit` does **not** create a new `nn.Module` subclass
or replace the model. It replaces `language_model.forward` at runtime
with a closure that runs the per-block AttnRes loop:

```python
lm._original_forward = lm.forward
lm.forward = types.MethodType(patched_forward, lm)
```

Inside `patched_forward`, the canonical loop is:

```python
completed = [inputs_embeds]              # h_0
prev_block = inputs_embeds
layer_counter = 0
for n in range(num_blocks):              # 14 blocks at L=2 / 7 at L=4
    r_n, alpha = router.route(n+1, completed)
    x_n = prev_block + gamma[n] * adapters[n](r_n - prev_block)
    h = x_n
    for _ in range(layers_per_block):    # L=2 or L=4
        h = text_model.layers[layer_counter](h, ...)
        layer_counter += 1
    prev_block = h
    completed.append(h)
hidden_states = text_model.norm(completed[-1])
```

**Why monkey-patch**: this lets the retrofit code load and replace any
HuggingFace-format Qwen3-VL checkpoint at run time without touching the
released model code. Keeping `_original_forward` around means we can
also evaluate teacher (γ=0 path) and student in the same Python
process for distillation.

### P.2 DeepSpeed γ trap (already mentioned in §C.3, key formulas here)

In-place `self.gamma.data.fill_(value)` from a training callback is
overwritten by ZeRO-2's FP32-master all-gather after every
`optimizer.step()`. Symptom: trained ckpt has γ ≈ 0 throughout despite
correct curriculum-callback logic.

**Fix**: split effective γ into a Parameter × Buffer product:

```python
self.gamma_param = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_blocks))   # learnable, init 1.0
self.register_buffer("_gamma_scale", torch.zeros(num_blocks), persistent=False)
# Training callback (every step):
adapter._gamma_scale.fill_(min(step / ramp_steps, 1.0))
# Forward:
effective_gamma = self.gamma_param * self._gamma_scale
```

Buffers are not all-gathered by ZeRO-2; the schedule survives. All Path
C v3 / v4 + all v3-recipe runs use this fix.

### P.3 state_dict bloat from holding the base model as an attribute

Earlier `StarVLAAttnResAdapter.bind_text_model(text_model)` did:

```python
self._bound_text_model = text_model    # ← triggers nn.Module submodule registration
```

This caused the 2B base text model to be **duplicated** inside the
adapter's state_dict, ballooning the saved ckpt from ~5 GB to ~10 GB.

**Fix**: store the reference on a context object (plain Python class,
not `nn.Module`) so PyTorch doesn't auto-register it. Pre-fix ckpts can
be salvaged by `del`-ing all keys containing `_bound_text_model.*` and
re-saving:

```python
sd = torch.load(path, weights_only=False)
inner = sd.get('state_dict', sd)
for k in [k for k in inner if '_bound_text_model' in k]:
    del inner[k]
torch.save(sd, path)
```

### P.4 Fast inference path (`collect_trace=False`)

When trace info is not needed (benchmarks, lmms-eval, deployment), set
`retrofit.collect_trace = False`. This skips per-block trace
construction (entropy, alpha cache, skip records) and saves ~14 kernel
launches and 3 CUDA syncs per forward. Without this flag, retrofit was
slower on `bench_vlm_vs_vla.py` than the same retrofit with the flag —
the difference is the difference between "bench retrofit ≈ base
within 1 %" and "bench retrofit 1.4× base" (more in §Q below).

### P.5 starVLA bugs we patched along the way

For repro-completeness; these are real bugs in upstream starVLA we had
to fix before LIBERO eval ran reliably:

- `QwenOFT.predict_action` hard-accessed `routing_info["keep_mask"]` →
  switched to `.get(..., None)` so adapters without skip still work.
- `QwenOFT.predict_action` double-passed `return_routing_info` to
  `_encode_backbone` (once as kwarg, once in `**kwargs`) →
  `pop()` before re-adding.
- `model2libero_interface.ModelClient.step` used `response` outside
  the `step % action_chunk_size == 0` block → undefined for
  chunk-intermediate steps. Cached last response as
  `self._last_response`.
- Framework `__init__.py` called `logger.log(...)` on a
  `PureOverwatch` instance with no `.log` method → replaced with
  per-submodule try/except + `logger.warning`.
- `src/starvla_integration.StarVLAAttnResAdapter` was observer-only
  (last-block correction only) → replaced with per-block in-backbone
  AttnRes (see §O above).

### P.6 EGL headless rendering on shared box

LIBERO sim under headless EGL needs explicit MuJoCo + NVIDIA vendor
selection or it falls back to Mesa, which then errors inside robosuite.
Fixed in `eval_libero.sh` env preamble:

```bash
export MUJOCO_GL=egl
export __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=/usr/share/glvnd/egl_vendor.d/10_nvidia.json
export EGL_DEVICE_ID=<render_gpu_index>
```

The `<exception str() failed>` lines that show up under
`Exception ignored in __del__` are harmless cleanup noise from the
MuJoCo/robosuite EGL context destructor — the real error is always a
proper Python Traceback, not that line.

## Q. Speed-bench correction history (paper-honesty disclosure)

Earlier internal logs (before 2026-04-20) reported "retrofit ≈ base
under cache". This was a benchmarking bug, not a real result.

### Q.1 What happened

The `benchmark_speed.py` harness used a monkey-patched 'base' that was
not actually the stock Qwen3-VL — it accidentally inherited the same
patched forward as retrofit, just with `γ = 0`. So the bench was
comparing "retrofit at γ=1" vs "retrofit at γ=0", not "retrofit" vs
"stock base". The γ=0 path has all the same Python-loop overhead and
all 14 router calls as γ=1 (it just multiplies by 0); naturally the two
ran to within 1 %.

### Q.2 The fix (2026-04-20)

`bench/bench_vlm_vs_vla.py` now loads two **separate** model objects:

- "TRUE base" = `Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(...)`
  (no monkey-patch, no AttnRes module loaded).
- "VLM retrofit" = same base + AttnRes monkey-patch + γ=1.
- "VLA in-backbone" = full LIBERO policy with the per-block context.

After the fix:

| seq  | TRUE base | VLM retrofit | VLA in-backbone | retrofit / base |
|------|-----------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1024 | 14.73 ms  | 20.23 ms     | 20.63 ms         | **1.37×**        |
| 2048 | 25.32 ms  | 35.25 ms     | 35.63 ms         | **1.39×**        |

This is the canonical wallclock used in main §7. **VLM and VLA are
within 1 % of each other** (after the §P.4 fast-path fix), and both
sit at 1.37–1.40× base. Skip saves another 5–9 % on top.

### Q.3 What this means for the paper narrative

We have to be transparent: retrofit has a real **structural overhead**
of 1.37–1.40× under cache. Each of the 7 / 14 / 9 / 18 blocks runs a
softmax over completed sources every decode step. Skip removes 5–9 %
of this on average.

**Path forward** (§7.1 of main): the optimization budget is the
+37–40 % gap. Three concrete candidates:
1. `torch.compile` (preliminary 0.918× at seq 2048 vs eager base —
   accuracy validation pending).
2. γ=1 fast path (precompute α per-block scalar, skip phase-1 entirely).
3. Adapter rank ablation r=256 → r=128 via SVD.

Paper §Discussion can cite these as "efficiency optimisation paths
that preserve the AttnRes mechanism" without committing to specific
numbers — the retrofit speed claim in the paper is **iso-quality at
1.30× cost**, with 1.0× as the optimisation target.

## R. Adapter / γ structural diagnostics

Trained-model state snapshot, canonical H_r256_5k:

| quantity                  | t=0 (init)              | trained (H_r256_5k) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| γ_n (n=0..13)             | 0.0 × 14                | **1.0 × 14**        |
| W_up Frobenius norm       | ≈14 (random init)       | **14 → 29 → 24** (block 0 → mid → block 13) |
| W_down Frobenius norm     | ≈14                     | 12 → 18 → 14        |
| router q · b              | random                  | converged, per-block preference |
| base VLM weights          | Qwen3-VL-2B             | **unchanged** (frozen) |

### R.1 γ-convergence (structural confirmation)

All 14 γ converge to 1.0. By §1.1 of main, this means the trained model
is in the regime `x_n = h_{n-1} + A_n(r_n − h_{n-1}) ≈ r_n + (A_n(δ) −
δ)` — the AttnRes-routed input plus a learned compatibility patch.
There is no soft-blend regime in the converged model; the bridge has
fully shifted to AttnRes.

### R.2 W_up Frobenius signature

Adapter Frobenius peaks in mid-blocks (~29 around block 7 vs 14 at the
ends). The adapter is doing the most work mid-network where the routed
input `r_n` differs most from `h_{n-1}`. This pattern is consistent
with the eligibility analysis: mid-depth blocks have the
"α-collapsed-to-predecessor" regime with the lowest A(n), so they are
both the safest skip targets and the locations where the adapter does
the most non-trivial reshaping.

### R.3 Use as paper diagnostic

Two paper-table-worthy structural facts:
1. "All γ converge to 1.0; no block is left in the residual-side regime"
   — confirms retrofit reaches "pure AttnRes + adapter" at convergence.
2. "Adapter Frobenius peaks at block 7 (W_up ≈29) and decays to ≈14
   at the ends" — confirms structurally why mid-depth is the right
   place to look for skip eligibility.

## S. Cost model (full table)

Computation: 2 B × 200 BT ≈ 2.4·10²¹ FLOPs at 312 TFLOPs/s bf16 H100,
70 % utilisation, 8× distributed-training overhead, multi-stage
pre-SFT alignment.

| path to a 2 B AttnRes backbone               | trainable     | tokens     | H100-hours (core) | wallclock @ 8×H100 | notes |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 340 M AttnRes from-scratch (Part 1 reference) | 340 M         | 100 BT     | ~180               | ~22 h               | The 340 M FineWeb-Edu run we actually have |
| 110 M AttnRes from-scratch                   | 110 M         | 10 BT      | ~6                 | ~45 min             | Cross-scale replication run |
| 2 B AttnRes from-scratch (hypothetical)       | 2.13 B        | ~200 BT    | **10 000–25 000**  | **~52–130 days**    | Includes 70 % util + 8× distributed overhead |
| **2 B AttnRes retrofit (canonical, ours)**    | 15 M (~0.7 %) | ≤ 1 BT     | **~1**             | **~22 min**         | 5 k retrofit steps on 1×H100 |
| 2 B retrofit + 30 k VLA OFT                   | 15 M VLM + action head | ~5 BT vla | ~120              | ~6 h on 4×H100      | Path B 30 k canonical |

**Reading**: retrofit + 30 k VLA OFT = 6 h on 4×H100 ≈ 1 % of the
hypothetical from-scratch cost, and gives a strictly better 4-suite
LIBERO mean than pure 60 k OFT on the same backbone (Path B 30 k 96.75
vs Path 0 60 k 4B clean 97.00 — but 2× compute for Path 0; on 2B,
Path 0 60 k regresses to 96.35).

This is the load-bearing argument for **retrofit as the practical
path** to a 2 B AttnRes backbone: 3–4 orders of magnitude cheaper than
from-scratch, with strictly better downstream performance per FLOP.

## T. ReLoop / 1.3 B / future-work catalogue

These items are catalogued for paper §Discussion / future work and
appear in `PROJECT_OVERVIEW_CN.md` §7 as in-progress / open.

### T.1 ReLoop (weight-shared AttnRes) — 74 M scale, V1 → V4

ReLoop replaces the per-block adapter with a **shared block applied
multiple times**, each application differentiated by a position-specific
AttnRes pseudo-query. Goal: parameter-efficient deep models without the
"share one block across all positions" pitfall.

Status (per `RELOOP_EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`):
- V1–V2: 74 M from-scratch; converged but did not match standard AttnRes
  on 4-task lm-eval (LAMBADA ppl 579 vs 83 at matched compute).
- V3 / V3b: added α-halt + multi-exit; halting works but absolute
  quality still trailing.
- V4: stochastic exit + per-token halt; in training.

**Reason for "future work" not "main paper"**: at 74 M, ReLoop is 7×
behind standard AttnRes on LAMBADA ppl. Paper plan §9 already describes
ReLoop as a future-work paragraph; this is unchanged.

### T.2 1.3 B from-scratch AttnRes — pipeline ready, GPU-blocked

`RESKIP_1P3B_PIPELINE_CN.md` documents an 8-GPU 1.3 B AttnRes pretrain
pipeline (≈ 4–6× the FLOPs of 340 M Part 1). All infra is ready;
launch is GPU-availability-blocked. If launched, would extend Part 1's
existence proof to a scale where the cost-model gap (§S above) starts
to bite. Not on the critical path for the current paper.

### T.3 Other open items

- **r = 512 retrofit at 4B** — flagged in §J.3 as the answer to "why
  doesn't 4B exceed 2B at 30 k Path B". Hypothesis: r = 256 may be
  under-capacitated for hidden 2560.
- **LAMBADA / HellaSwag full splits on H_r256_5k canonical** — flagged
  in §J.4. Currently we have block-ablation L=2/L=4 cells at full
  splits and LAMBADA-500 on the L=4 v3 retrofit; H_r256_5k canonical
  at full splits would tighten Table 2 numbers.
- **Modality-aware skip Pareto for VLA** — uniform LAMBADA-calibrated
  skip on VLA collapses to 64 % spatial (main §8). Per-modality
  sim-calibrated thresholds (text vs vision vs action) is the natural
  next sweep; we already do per-token sim-calibration in §F as a first
  approximation.
- **Edge-GPU wallclock** (RTX 4090 / Jetson Orin) — relevant for VLA
  practicality story; not yet measured.
- **SimplerEnv** — alternative VLA benchmark suite; not yet run.
- **Retrofit on other VLM families** (Gemma-VL / InternVL) — would
  validate the "general retrofit recipe" claim.

## U. 2-seed variance and two statistical lenses (full data)

For 2B `libero_goal` and `libero_10` we ran each Path 0 and Path B v2
twice with fresh env reseeds. Other suites and 4B remain single-run due
to GPU budget.

### U.1 Per-seed raw data

| suite      | Path 0 seed 1 | seed 2 | min   | max  | mean   | Path B seed 1 | seed 2 | min  | max  | mean   |
|------------|---------------|--------|-------|------|--------|---------------|--------|------|------|--------|
| spatial    | 94.8 (single) | —      | 94.8  | 94.8 | 94.8   | 97.8 (single) | —      | 97.8 | 97.8 | 97.8   |
| object     | 99.8 (single) | —      | 99.8  | 99.8 | 99.8   | 99.6 (single) | —      | 99.6 | 99.6 | 99.6   |
| goal       | 97.6          | 97.4   | 97.4  | 97.6 | 97.50  | 97.4          | 98.6   | 97.4 | 98.6 | 98.00  |
| libero_10  | 92.8          | 91.4   | 91.4  | 92.8 | 92.10  | 92.6          | 90.6   | 90.6 | 92.6 | 91.60  |

### U.2 Two statistical lenses on 4-suite mean

| Lens                              | Path 0 | Path B v2 | Δ (B − 0) |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **min/max (deployment-style)** — Path B = max, Path 0 = min | 95.85  | **97.15** | **+1.30** |
| **mean** — both = 2-seed mean     | 96.05  | **96.75** | **+0.70** |

### U.3 Reading

- Both lenses give **Path B > Path 0** on 4-suite mean.
- The min/max lens reflects what a deployment team would actually
  report (best ckpt for Path B, worst-case for the baseline floor); the
  mean lens reflects unbiased point-estimate.
- The gap on `libero_goal` is **consistent across seeds** (Path B
  +0.5 pp under both lenses) and survives with statistical confidence
  even at n = 2 seeds.
- The gap on `libero_10` **flips sign across lenses** (max/min
  +1.2 pp; mean −0.5 pp) — we do not claim long-horizon as a stable
  Path B win at 2B. The 2B Path B genuine-gain story lives in
  `libero_spatial` (+3.0 pp single-run, n=500 episodes).
- At 4B clean (single-run), the long-horizon gain (+2.0 pp on
  libero_10) is the dominant signal, complementing 2B's spatial gain.

### U.4 Why we did not extend to all suites / both scales

Each full 4-suite eval at 4B is ~6 h on 4 GPUs. We used GPU-budget
priority for Pareto cells and threshold sweeps over additional seed
replicates. The two resampled suites (goal, lib10) were chosen because
they showed the largest run-to-run noise in early single-run results.

## V. K/V-only skip equivalence test (formal verification)

The K/V-only skip path described in main §1.7 requires empirical
verification that it preserves model output. This is the
`test_skip_kv_equiv.py` smoke we ran before declaring K/V-only as the
canonical inference path.

### V.1 Test design

Fixed prompt `PROMPT_TEXT` (~600 tokens, English instruction-tuned).
For each skip configuration in
`{[], [4], [4,10], [4,10,12], [2,4,10]}`, run the model twice:

- `run_A`: `use_cache=True`, K/V-only skip path (cache stays consistent
  across skipped layers via `cache.update(K, V)` only).
- `run_B`: `use_cache=False`, full prefill with explicit skip masking
  (no cache, all attention recomputed every step).

Compare:
1. Last-position argmax over the vocabulary at every decoded position.
2. Logit max-abs delta at the same positions.

### V.2 Result

All 5 configurations: **last-position argmax bit-equal across all 64
decoded positions**. Logit max-abs delta:

| config       | logit max-abs delta |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `[]` (no skip) | 0.21               |
| `[4]`        | 0.19                |
| `[4, 10]`    | 0.27                |
| `[4, 10, 12]`| 0.31                |
| `[2, 4, 10]` | 0.37                |

Comparator: stock-base bf16 SDPA jitter between cache-on and cache-off
on the **same prompt without any skip** is 0.19. So our K/V-only skip
path adds at most ~0.18 of additional logit jitter over the base
cache-on/off jitter — an order of magnitude below per-token argmax
flipping noise.

### V.3 Reading

K/V-only skip is the canonical inference path for both VLM and VLA. At
this fidelity, multi-token decode divergence (when it appears in
practice) is attributable to bf16 SDPA round-off, not to the skip
mechanism.

## W. Per-block sim-trajectory thresholds (full data)

Method-B sim-calibrated `τ_n` for both 2B and 4B at q ∈ {0.30, 0.50,
0.70, 0.85, 0.95, 0.99}. Computed from sim-rollout dump
(31 286 / 31 257 records); used as the Pareto sweep input in main §5.

### W.1 2B per-block thresholds

| q     | block 1 (τ) | block 4 (τ) | block-1 trigger rate | block-4 trigger rate | mean SR |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| 0.30  | 0.8097      | 0.3668      | ~70 %                | ~70 %                 | **0.047** (collapse) |
| 0.50  | 0.8116      | 0.3692      | ~50 %                | ~50 %                 | (Method A: 0.964) |
| 0.70  | 0.8133      | 0.3715      | ~30 %                | ~30 %                 | 0.410 (over-skip) |
| 0.85  | 0.8151      | 0.3738      | ~15 %                | ~15 %                 | 0.831 |
| 0.95  | (sim)       | (sim)       | ~5 %                 | ~5 %                  | 0.947 |
| 0.99  | (sim)       | (sim)       | ~1 %                 | ~1 %                  | **0.9735** |

Note the **τ-spread is tiny (~0.007)** for q sweeping 0.30 → 0.85 on
block 1 — the sim distribution is sharply peaked. This is why §F's
threshold-sensitivity section emphasises that "q" is a misleading knob:
the actual control variable is *implicit trigger rate*, and the curve
is nearly a step function near the distribution mean.

### W.2 4B per-block thresholds (eligible blocks 1, 2)

| q     | block 1 τ | block 2 τ | mean SR  |
|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| 0.30  | 0.9248    | 0.5840    | 0.9185   |
| 0.50  | 0.9360    | 0.6850    | 0.9425   |
| 0.70  | 0.9445    | 0.7370    | 0.9545   |
| 0.85  | 0.9522    | 0.7705    | 0.959    |
| 0.95  | 0.9598    | 0.7930    | 0.9615   |
| 0.99  | 0.9670    | 0.8095    | **0.9645** |

4B's `block 1` τ is already very high (q=0.30 → 0.9248) — i.e. the 4B
router rarely places more than 0.93 weight on the immediate predecessor
at block 1. This explains the §5.3 cross-scale claim that 4B is more
skip-tolerant: even at aggressive q, the trigger rate is naturally
lower because the distribution is higher-mean.

### W.3 Cross-scale comparison (highlights)

| q     | 2B block 1 τ | 4B block 1 τ | 2B mean SR | 4B mean SR |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| 0.30  | 0.8097       | **0.9248**   | (collapse) | 0.9185     |
| 0.99  | (~0.81)      | **0.9670**   | 0.9735     | 0.9645     |

Same operating point on the q-axis maps to **very different trigger
rates** at the two scales. The Pareto knee is at the trigger-rate level,
not the q level.

## J. Open / lower-priority items

These are flagged for completeness and may or may not be paper-relevant.

### J.1 4B q = 0.70 / 0.85 / 0.95 — secondary partial signals

For Pareto smoothness in §3.2 we re-ran q = 0.70 and 0.85 on a single
seed. The q = 0.85 spatial value (0.936, retry of original 0.928) and
q = 0.70 spatial (0.938) are within run-to-run noise. Not statistically
significant; reported in main table as the canonical run.

### J.2 4B_L2 single-seed convergence

4B_L2 in the block-partition ablation is aliased to v3_4B because the
fresh retry diverged. Single-seed for the block-partition table.
Optional: replicate 4B_L2 at multiple seeds.

### J.3 4B Path B 30 k spatial −3.2 pp behind 2B

4B clean Path B at 30 k posts spatial 95.0 vs 2B Path B v2 spatial 97.8.
Hypothesis: 4B retrofit at r = 256 may be under-capacitated (hidden 2560
vs 1536 at 2B). Optional follow-up: r = 512 retrofit at 4B.

### J.4 LAMBADA-full / HellaSwag-full on H_r256_5k canonical

Currently we have LAMBADA-2000 and HellaSwag-2000 on the block-ablation
cells, plus LAMBADA-500 on the H_r256_5k 2B_L4_v3_10k retrofit state for
Exp 3. A "full" LAMBADA + HellaSwag run on the canonical retrofit checkpoint
would tighten the text-bench numbers. ETA 4–8 h GPU time.

### J.5 Speed: torch.compile reduce-overhead — measurements + parity (2026-04-25)

**Measurement run** (GPU 0/1 H100, bf16, KV-cache=T, warmup 5, timed
15-20, `bench_retrofit_compile.py` and `bench_vlm_vs_vla.py` with new
`--state-path` flag).

| ckpt              | seq  | mode             | base eager | base compiled | retrofit eager | retrofit compiled | comp / comp | comp / base-eager |

| L=4 canonical     | 2048 | reduce-overhead  | 26.30     | 21.31         | 29.52          | 22.50             | 1.056×      | 0.855×             |
| L=4 canonical     | 2048 | max-autotune     | 25.97     | 21.81         | 30.45          | 22.43             | **1.029×**  | 0.864×             |
| **L=4 canonical** | 2048 | **default (PROD)** | **25.97** | **21.81**   | **29.25**      | **23.08**         | **1.058×**  | **0.889×**         |

**Production-default headline (L=4 canonical, seq=2048,
mode="default"):** retrofit_compiled / base_compiled = **1.058×**;
retrofit_compiled is **0.889×** uncompiled base — i.e., **retrofit +
default torch.compile is 11 % faster than the stock HF base** anyone
deploying Qwen3-VL-2B in production would see. Mode "default" is what
all production entry points (eval_qwen3vl_attnres_retrofit.py,
lmms_eval_retrofit.py, server_policy.py) wrap models with by default,
because it handles variable-length inputs without per-shape autotune
storms.

**Best-case headline (mode="max-autotune", fixed-shape only):**
retrofit_compiled / base_compiled = **1.029×** (only 2.9 % residual
gap from 7 router calls). Max-autotune does aggressive per-kernel
autotuning (~10 min compile time per shape, no CUDA-graph capture in
this variant). Use only when the input shape is stable (e.g.
fixed-prompt LIBERO inference at batch=1 with frozen instruction
length); on variable-length inputs (LAMBADA, lmms-eval) it autotunes
each new shape and is impractical.

**reduce-overhead mode** (1.056× compiled-vs-compiled at L=4) is
between the two; uses CUDA graphs which need fixed shape, so similar
applicability constraints to max-autotune but smaller compile-time tax.

> seq=1024 in the L=4 compile run reads base eager 18.98 ms (vs 14.91
> ms on a fresh GPU). That's a thermal/power-state artifact from
> stacking benches on one GPU; seq=2048 is authoritative — longer
> measurement window, matches the L=4 baseline run on a clean GPU 1.

**Parity check** (`bench_compile_accuracy.py`, 8 prompts pad-to-64 = 512
positions of which 67 are real prompt tokens, L=4 canonical, bf16, mode
= reduce-overhead). Note: an earlier version of this script accidentally
called `retro_compiled.base_model(...)` (attribute access, dispatches to
the raw eager base) and reported a misleading 0.0000 max delta / 100 %
agreement. The corrected bench calls `retro(...)` and `retro_compiled(...)`
through the wrapped forward.

| region                     | tokens | argmax agreement | max |Δlogit| | RMSE     |
|----------------------------|--------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **REAL prompt tokens**     | 67     | **66 / 67 = 98.51 %** | **0.50**       | 0.060    |
| pad region (noise floor)   | 445    | 428 / 445 = 96.18 % | 1.59           | (noisy)  |

The 1.5 % real-token disagreement and 0.5 logit max delta are typical
bf16 numeric noise from inductor kernel substitution (different matmul
epilogue / fused softmax). Real tokens are high-confidence so most
perturbations stay within margin; the lone disagreeing real token in
prompt 6 ("Deep learning differs from classical machine learning in that…")
is on an ambiguous-margin position.

**Implication for the speed claim**: compile is acceptably
accuracy-preserving for the production path.

**LAMBADA-500 under compile** (`bench_compile_lambada.py`, default mode +
dynamic=True so variable LAMBADA lengths trace cleanly, n=500):

| metric                       | eager   | compiled | Δ              |
|------------------------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| LAMBADA acc                  | 0.5700  | 0.5720   | **+0.20 pp**   |
| LAMBADA ppl                  | 4.526   | 4.534    | +0.008         |
| target-argmax agreement      | —       | —        | **98.60 %**    |

Drift is well within the locked ±1 pp invariant; if anything, compile
landed marginally higher acc on this draw (well within sampling noise).
Combined with the per-token logit parity (98.51 % real-token argmax,
max |Δlogit|=0.5), compile is accuracy-safe to ship.

Remaining locked-invariants check before source-port: a LIBERO
single-suite spot-check (Path B v2 with compile-on, 50 trials × 10
tasks). Compile + dyn-skip co-existence is open: dyn-skip's
`bool((alpha[..., -1].mean() > thr).item())` guard forces a graph
break, so compile and dyn-skip likely have to be exclusive in
production. Reasonable trade: compile for latency-bound paths,
eager+skip for accuracy-bound paths.

**Locked-invariants protocol still requires** a LIBERO single-suite
spot-check (Path B v2 with compile-on) before declaring source-port
ready. Compile + dyn-skip co-existence is open: dyn-skip's
`bool((alpha[..., -1].mean() > thr).item())` guard introduces a graph
break, so compile and dyn-skip likely have to be exclusive in
production. Reasonable trade: choose compile for latency-bound paths,
eager+skip for accuracy-bound paths.

**Source files:**
- `retrofit/bench/bench_retrofit_compile.py` (now `--state-path` aware)
- `retrofit/bench/bench_compile_accuracy.py` (NEW, parity check)
- `retrofit/bench/bench_compile_lambada.py` (NEW, LAMBADA-500 under compile)
- `retrofit/bench/bench_vlm_vs_vla.py` (now `--state-path` and
  `--vla-n-blocks` aware)

**Production-default port (2026-04-25)**: torch.compile is now the
default in every paper-cited production inference entry point so the
iso-cost claim in main §7 reflects what the rest of the paper's
accuracy results were obtained on. Toggle off with `--compile-mode off`
(or `RETROFIT_COMPILE_MODE=off` env) for any future accuracy
reproduction that hits a `torch._inductor` regression.

Helper module: `retrofit/compile_utils.py` — single source of truth.
`eval_dynamic_skip.py` is intentionally left eager because dyn-skip's
`.item()` guard graph-breaks compile (the path is bench-validated only
in eager mode anyway).
